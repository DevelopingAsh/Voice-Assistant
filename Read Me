Regarding operating this project, the main.py file is the file you are supposed to run 
to initially launch the front end part of the project. The microphone button on the page 
allows you to access the voice assistant by clicking on it. Once clicked, minimize the 
Tkinter window and use the feedbacks provided in the terminal to proceed. The chatbot is
just something I added to enhance the front end aspect of it. It is trained on a simple
JSON file. It is not the cneter of attraction here. Cool! That's about it. Hope you have
fun exploring through the project.
